## Goals

The primary objectives of the Media Hub are:

1.  **Provide a Controlled Media Source:** To create a secure, internal repository of images and videos for students, replacing the need for external services like YouTube or Google Images.

2.  **Ensure Zero-Data Compatibility:** To guarantee that all media assets are accessible in environments with restricted or no internet access, where only Smart Brains domains are zero-rated.

3.  **Preserve the Student Mental Model:** To offer a user experience that is identical to the one students are already familiar with, specifically regarding copying embed codes (`<iframe>`) for videos and image URLs (`<img>`) for pictures.

4.  **Simplify Administration:** To provide a simple and secure interface for internal staff to manage the entire lifecycle of media assets.

## Non-Goals

The Media Hub is intentionally limited in scope. The following are explicitly **not** goals for this project:

1.  **No Social or Interactive Features:** The platform is not a social network. There will be no comments, likes, user profiles (for students), or other social engagement features.

2.  **No Student Content Creation:** Students are strictly consumers of media. They cannot upload, edit, or manage any content.

3.  **No Curriculum or Categorization:** The media library is a flat, unstructured collection of assets. The system will not include any features for categorization, tagging, curriculum mapping, or organizing content by grade level or topic.

4.  **No External Content Integration:** The platform must not embed or rely on any third-party services for its core functionality. All media is hosted and served internally.

5.  **Not a General-Purpose CMS:** The project is a focused utility, not a flexible or extensible Content Management System.
