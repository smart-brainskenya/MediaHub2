# Smart Brains Media Hub

The Smart Brains Media Hub is a public, zero-data-compatible media platform allowing students to safely access images and videos for coding projects. It serves as an internal, controlled alternative to external sources like YouTube and Google Images, especially in environments with restricted internet access.

**Key Features:**
-   **Zero-Data Compatibility:** All media is hosted internally, ensuring access without relying on external internet connectivity.
-   **Familiar Student Workflow:** Provides embed codes for videos (`<iframe>`) and direct URLs/tags for images (`<img>`) that mimic common external platforms.
-   **Admin-Only Management:** Secure interface for Smart Brains staff to upload, import, and manage all media assets.

**Project Specification:**
The entire project is strictly governed by the specifications defined in the `ai-spec/` directory. `ai-spec/00_CANONICAL_OVERVIEW.md` is the authoritative source for all requirements, constraints, and mental models. All development must align with these documents.
